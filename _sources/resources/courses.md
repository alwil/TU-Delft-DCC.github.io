### Software Sustainability Institute
Since 2010, the Software Sustainability Institute has facilitated the advancement of software in research by cultivating better, more sustainable, research software to enable world-class research (“Better software, better research”). The Institute is based at the Universities of Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford and Southampton, and draws on a team of experts with a breadth of experience in software development, project and programme management, research facilitation, publicity and community engagement.

You can view their upcoming workshops at https://www.software.ac.uk/news.

## DCC project workshops

As part of the support it provides, the DCC also develops tailor-made workshops to address specific needs of researchers not covered by general workshop materials. We always aim to have our workshops publicaly available. 

### Python Essentials for GIS Learners

_This 3-day long workshop is for beginners with zero programming experience. We are going to work with very simple geospatial datasets as examples, but it is not exclusive or focused only on GIS. By the end of this workshop, you will learn fundamental concepts of programming with python, version control, and how to work with the command line. We will also demonstrate how these tools are useful and make sense in the context of GIS. We hope to get you inspired and motivated to use these tools in your future research!_
